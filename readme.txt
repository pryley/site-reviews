Site Reviews allows you to easily receive and display reviews for your website, business, or products.

== Description ==

Site Reviews allows your visitors to submit reviews with a 1-5 star rating on your website, similar to the way you would on TripAdvisor or Yelp. The plugin provides blocks, shortcodes, and widgets, along with full documentation.

You can pin your best reviews so that they are always shown first, require approval before new review submissions are published, require visitors to be logged-in in order to write a review, send custom notifications on a new submission, and a lot more!

__Site Reviews integrates with Woocommerce__ with the free [Woocommerce Reviews](https://niftyplugins.com/plugins/woocommerce-reviews/) add-on.
