Site Reviews is a complete review management solution for your website that is designed to work in a similar way to Amazon, TripAdvisor, and Yelp.

== Description ==

Site Reviews is a complete review management solution for your website that is designed to work in a similar way to Amazon, TripAdvisor, and Yelp. The plugin provides blocks, shortcodes, and widgets, along with full documentation.

You can pin your best reviews so that they are always shown first, mark reviews as verified, require approval before new reviews are published, require visitors to be logged-in in order to write a review, send a custom notification when reviews are submitted, respond to reviews, and a lot more!

Site Reviews provides more features and options than almost every other free review plugin, and the support provided on the WordPress forum is excellent.

== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option -- WordPress will handle the file transfer, and you won’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Site Reviews, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click “Add New.”

In the search field type “Site Reviews,” then click “Search Plugins.” Once you’ve found it, you can view the plugin details such as the point release, rating, and description. Install it by clicking “Install Now,” and WordPress will take it from there.

Manual installation method requires downloading the Site Reviews plugin and uploading it to your web server with a FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we still recommend you back up your site.

If you encounter issues with your reviews after an update, go to the Site Reviews Tools page and run the "Migrate Plugin" tool. That should return things to normal.
