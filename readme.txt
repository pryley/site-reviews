Site Reviews is a complete review management solution for your website, business, or products.

== Description ==

Site Reviews allows your visitors to submit reviews with a 1-5 star rating on your website, similar to the way you would on TripAdvisor or Yelp. The plugin provides blocks, shortcodes, and widgets, along with full documentation.

You can pin your best reviews so that they are always shown first, require approval before new review submissions are published, require visitors to be logged-in in order to write a review, send custom notifications on a new submission, and a lot more!

__Site Reviews integrates with Woocommerce__ with the free [Woocommerce Reviews](https://niftyplugins.com/plugins/woocommerce-reviews/) add-on.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

- WordPress 5.8 or greater
* PHP 7.2 or greater
* MySQL 5.6 or greater

If your server and website does not meet the minimum requirements shown below, the plugin will automatically deactivate and a notice will appear explaining why.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option -- WordPress will handle the file transfer, and you won’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Site Reviews, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click “Add New.”

In the search field type “Site Reviews,” then click “Search Plugins.” Once you’ve found it, you can view the plugin details such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by clicking “Install Now,” and WordPress will take it from there.

= Manual installation =

Manual installation method requires downloading the Site Reviews plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we still recommend you back up your site.

If you encounter issues with your reviews after an update, go to the Site Reviews Tools page and run the "Migrate Plugin" tool. That should return things to normal.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
