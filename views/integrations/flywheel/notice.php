    <p>Site Reviews adds foreign key constraints to its custom database tables to make database queries perform much faster.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, Flywheel does not migrate foreign key constraints correctly; you will need to deactivate Site Reviews before performing the migration to ensure that your reviews are migrated successfully.</p>
    <p>Once you have finished migrating your site, you may reactivate Site Reviews.</p>
